        <p>Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user
         interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of
          designing. Thus &quot;design&quot; may be a substantive referring to a categorical
           abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the
            process of creation, as is made clear by grammatical context. In some cases the direct
             construction of an object is also considered to be design.</p>

        <p>With such a broad denotation, there is no universal language or unifying institution for
         designers of all disciplines. More formally design has been defined as follows. Design is
          the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or
           measurable human interaction.</p>
