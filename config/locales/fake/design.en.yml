    design:
      - Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction
      - Design has different connotations in different fields
      - In some cases the direct construction of an object is also considered to be design
      - Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process
      - It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design
      - Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of designing
      - Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation, as is made clear by grammatical context
      - More formally design has been defined as follows
      - Another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation
      - It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective
      - Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed
      - With such a broad denotation, there is no universal language or unifying institution for designers of all disciplines
      - This allows for many differing philosophies and approaches toward the subject
      - The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas, usually also specifying which area is being dealt with
      - A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process
      - The scientific study of design is called design science
      - Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs
      - The Rational Model was independently developed by Simon[14] and Pahl and Beitz
      - Designers attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives
      - The design process is plan-driven
      - The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages
      - The Rational Model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds
      - At least two views of design activity are consistent with the Action-Centric Perspective
      - Both involve three basic activities
      - Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice
