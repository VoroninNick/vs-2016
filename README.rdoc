* * Your custom partials live in app/views/projects/{code_name}/{partial_name}
* also optionally you can customize theme variables in controller: app/controllers/projects_controller.rb
* define your method named `init_{code_name}`. For example

def init_shuvar_info
    @project_bottom_banner = {bg_image_url: "projects/shuvar_info/bottom_banner.jpg", asset_path: true}
end


=== 3. customize your css:

* Please keep your css selectors and sass variables inside of body.theme-{code_name}

=== 4. localization
Your texts can live in admin panel or in config/locales/projects/{code_name}

=== 5. move to production
* git commit & git push
* create site in admin panel. Probably just copy your localhost strings from admin
* say to pasha to git pull
